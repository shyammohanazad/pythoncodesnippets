program to find maximum without using min() and max() funtion of python

student_score=input(Inpu the list of student heights with space between) .split()

for n in range(len(student_score)):
   student_score[n]=int(student_score[n])

# .split() method splits the string fom space i.e. wheever it finds a space in between it count it as single unit 
#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
